chrome dev tools:

react-dom_client.js?v=abacfe74:5747 Encountered two children with the same key, `resentful`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
