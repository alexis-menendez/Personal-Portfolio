# Team Git Workflow Guide  
Keep your branch up to date with main and avoid unnecessary conflicts.


## Step 1: Check Out Your Branch and Pull Remote Updates  
git checkout your-branch-name          # Switch to your branch  
git pull                               # Pull latest changes for your branch  


# Step 2: Stage, Commit, and Push Your Changes  
git add .                              # Stage all changed files  
git commit -m "Your commit message"    # Write a meaningful commit message  
git push origin your-branch-name       # Push your changes to GitHub  


# Step 3: Pull the Latest from main to Stay Updated  
git fetch origin                       # Get latest from all remote branches  
git merge origin/main                  # Merge latest main into your branch  
git push                               # Push updated branch


# Step 4: Check to make sure you are no longer behind!
